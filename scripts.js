  2: "Twenty-five years and my life is still, Trying to get up that great big hill of hope, For a destination, I realized quickly when I knew I should, That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man, For whatever that means, And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed, Just to get it all out what's in my head, And I, I am feeling a little peculiar, And so I wake in the morning and I step outside, And I take a deep breath and I get real high, and I Scream from the top of my lungs, What's going on?, And I say hey yeah yeah hey yeah yeah, I said hey what's going on?, And I say hey yeah yeah hey yeah yeah,I said hey what's going on?".split(', ')
